          Effective: February 24, 2021
          <br /><br />

          Thanks for using Lok! Here we describe how we collect, use, and handle your personal data when you use our service (“<strong>Service</strong>”).
          <br /><br />

          <strong>What & Why</strong> 
          <br /><br />

          We collect and use the following information to provide, improve, protect, and promote our Service.
          <br /><br />

          <i>Account information</i>. We collect, and associate with your account, the email address you provide when you sign up for your account.
          <br /><br />

          <i>Your Things</i>. Our service is designed as a simple and personalized way for you to store your files, documents, photos, comments, messages and so on ("<strong>Your Things</strong>"). To make that possible, we store, process, and transmit Your Things as well as information related to it. This related information includes your <Link to='/update-profile' target='_blank'>profile information</Link> that makes it easier to collaborate and share Your Stuff with others, as well as things like the size of the file, the time it was uploaded, collaborators, and usage activity.
          <br /><br />

          <i>Usage information</i>. We collect information related to how you use the Service, including actions you take in your account (like viewing, creating and moving files or folders). We use this information to provide, improve, and promote our Service, and protect Lok users.
          <br /><br />

          <i>Device information</i>. We also collect information from and about the devices you use to access the Service. This includes things like IP addresses, the type of browser and device you use, the web page you visited before coming to our site, and identifiers associated with your devices. Your devices (depending on their settings) may also transmit location information to the Service. For example, we use device information to detect abuse and identify and troubleshoot bugs.
          <br /><br />

          <i>Cookies and other technologies</i>. We use technologies like cookies and pixel tags to provide, improve, protect, and promote our Service. For example, cookies help us with things like remembering your username for your next visit, understanding how you are interacting with our Service, and improving them based on that information. You can set your browser to not accept cookies, but this may limit your ability to use the Service. We may also use third-party service providers that set cookies and similar technologies to promote Lok services.
          <br /><br />

          <i>Bases for processing your data</i>. We collect and use the personal data described above in order to provide you with the Service in a reliable and secure manner. We also collect and use personal data for our legitimate needs. To the extent we process your personal data for other purposes, we ask for your consent in advance or require that our partners obtain such consent.
          <br /><br />

          <strong>With Whom</strong>
          <br /><br />

          We may share information as discussed below, but we won’t sell it to advertisers or other third parties.
          <br /><br />

          <i>Others working for and with Lok</i>. Lok currently does not use third parties (for example, providers of customer support and IT services) for the business purposes of helping us provide, improve, protect, and promote our Service. However, we reserve the right to start at any time. These third parties would access your information to perform tasks on our behalf, and we’ll remain responsible for their handling of your information per our instructions.
          <br /><br />

          <i>Other Lok Companies</i>. Lok currently does not share infrastructure, systems, and technology with other Lok Companies to provide, improve, protect, and promote Lok Company Services. However, we reserve the right to start at any time. Your information would then be processed across the Lok Companies for these purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies.
          <br /><br />

          <i>Other users</i>. Our Service displays information like your email address and usage information to other users you collaborate or choose to share with. When you register your Lok account with an email address on a domain owned by your employer or organization, we may help collaborators and administrators find you and your team by making some of your basic information—like your name, team name, and email address—visible to other users on the same domain. This helps you sync up with teams you can join and helps other users share files and folders with you.
          <br /><br />

          Certain features let you make additional information available to others.
          <br /><br />

          <i>Other applications</i>. If in the event of third-party service integration--for example via <a href='https://www.firebase.com' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>Firebase</a>. By doing so, you’re enabling Lok and those third parties to exchange information about you and data in your account so that Lok and those third parties can provide, improve, protect, and promote their services. Please remember that third parties’ use of your information will be governed by their own privacy policies and terms of service.
          <br /><br />

          <i>Law & Order and the Public Interest</i>. We may disclose your information to third parties if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to:

          <ListGroup.Item>(a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or appropriate government request;</ListGroup.Item>

          Stewardship of your data is critical to us and a responsibility that we embrace. We believe that your data should receive the same legal protections regardless of whether it’s stored on our Service or on your home computer’s hard drive.

          <strong>How?</strong>
          <br /><br />

          <i>Security</i>. We have dedicated parameters in place to keeping your information secure and testing for vulnerabilities. We continue to work on features to keep your information safe in addition to things like encryption of files at rest. We deploy automated technologies to detect abusive behavior and content that may harm our Services, you, or other users.
          <br /><br />
          
          <i>User Controls</i>. You can access, amend, and delete your PERSONAL INFORMATION by logging into your Lok account and going to your <Link to='/update-profile' target='_blank'>account settings page</Link>.
          <br /><br />

          <i>Retention</i>. When you sign up for an account with us, we’ll retain information you store on our Service for as long as your account exists or as long as we need it to provide you the Service. 
          <br /><br />

          <strong>Where?</strong>
          <br /><br />

          <i>Around the world</i>. To provide you with the Service, we may store, process, and transmit data in the United States and locations around the world—including those outside your country. Data may also be stored locally on the devices you use to access the Service.
          <br /><br />

          <strong>Your Control and Access of Your Data</strong>
          <br /><br />

          You mostly have control over your personal data and how it’s collected, used, and shared. For example, you can:
        </Card.Text>

        <ListGroup variant='flush'>
          <ListGroup.Item>• <i>Change or correct personal data</i>. You can manage your account and the content contained in it, as well as edit some of your personal data, through your <Link to='/update-profile' target='_blank'>account settings page</Link>.</ListGroup.Item>
          <ListGroup.Item>• <i>Access and take your data elsewhere</i>. You can access your personal data from your Lok account and you can download a copy of Your Things in a machine readable format.</ListGroup.Item>
        </ListGroup>
        <br />

        <Card.Text>
          <strong>Changes</strong>
          <br /><br />

          If we’re involved in a reorganization, merger, acquisition, or sale of our assets, your data may be transferred as part of that deal. We’ll notify you (for example, via a message to the email address associated with your account) of any such deal and outline your choices in that event.
